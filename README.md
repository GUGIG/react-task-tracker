# React Study ("React JS Crash Course(1/19/2021)" by Traversy Media)
  
### 1. Studying React.js library via Traversy media's crash course Youtube video  
https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8
  
  
### 2. Using React Router v6, not v5.
Since the study material was posted *before* React Router v6 was released, I had to find different videos/blog posts to write v6 syntax.  
Major differences between v5 and v6 that I studied so far:  
- Switch vs Routes
- no "exact" attribute
- wildcard character "*" now used in path, undefined route, etc in v6

  
### 3. Stuffs that I implemented & going to implement in the future into this project
- ✅ useState
- ✅ useEffect
- ✅ useRef
- ✅ useMemo
- ✅ useCallback
- ✅ React.memo
- ✅ context api (useConetxt, etc)
- ✅ nested route
- ✅ custom hooks

### 4. Archive of things I studied/learned about React
